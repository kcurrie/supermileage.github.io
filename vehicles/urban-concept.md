    The Odysseus is the successor to the Argo. It sports several new modifications including a more aerodynamic body and a reduced vehicle weight. The vehicle weighs in at under 200 lbs, with a fireproof carbon fiber firewall and aluminum honeycomb chassis. The fuel injection system on the 50 cc gasoline engine also saw several efficiency enhancing improvements. All these improvements made the vehicle twice as efficient as its predecessor.

    The final revision of the Argo to be submitted to the Urban Concept Car class. This vehicle sports several important improvements over previous incarnations, including a lighter 50cc engine, an electronic fuel injection system, and bright LED tail and headlights. New requirements were in effect for the 2012 competition, necessitating the installation of a windshield wiper and a further iteration of the previous year&#8217;s door mechanism, which now splits the vehicle neatly in two when opened. Overall weight was again reduced.

It had a more rigid steering system, improved driver interface with the vehicle, a new door mechanism for reduced exit time in case of an emergency, custom spoked lightweight wheels, and the first iteration of a newly developed, 50cc engine. Despite a larger engine, added features and improved rigidity to the vehicle, the overall weight was reduced to 225 pounds. </div>
