The prototype class follows the &#8220;Mark&#8221; naming scheme. This is the original vehicle class that the UBC Supermileage Team participated in. Technical specifications for the UBC Supermileage Team&#8217;s prototype vehicles can be found [here][1].

In 2009/2010 the team transitioned to the relevant and practical [urban concept car][2]. Recently, resources have allowed the team to also continue development of the prototype vehicle.

**2013 &#8211; Mark VIII**

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-676 alignleft" title="Mark VIII" src="http://supermileage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Shell-Ecomarathon-1002-300x184.jpg" alt="VIII" width="211" height="129" />][3]The Mark series made a triumphant return in 2013 after a 4 year hiatus. Due to limited resources in constructing two vehicles simultaneously, the aeroshell was reused from previous years. This year featured a jackshaft transmission, which reduced losses in the drivetrain and was much lighter than the gearbox seen in the Urban Concept vehicle of the same year.

The quality of the aero shell was the best the team had built to date and the chassis design was optimized a little further.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to meet SEMA rules, the vehicle also featured front brakes and other new safety features.

    2007 &#8211; Mark VI
  </h4>

  <p>
    The 2006/2007 year was spent rebuilding the prototype vehicle from the ground up in order to turn over the design to an excited new, young team. In anticipation for the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas, the vehicle saw some improvements to the chassis and safety systems as well as manufacturing processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The manufacturing process for the aero shell was also improved again. New materials and methods were used while manufacturing the mould. This was the first time the team built a female mould and this enabled them to manufacture their carbon fibre aero shell very accurately and with an improved surface finish. This mould and manufacturing methods were carried towards later years&#8217; designs.

The vehicle shed a little more weight as well as see improved quality with some components. The material selection and manufacturing process for the aero shell were improved, giving the vehicle a stiffer, more durable body.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both the steering and engine were also tuned extensively, allowing for a significant reduction in energy loss within the vehicle during operation.

Significant time was spent in the wind tunnel and in CAD programs to design the 2005 vehicle. There was great pain taken to balance the features between smooth transitioning curves and reducing frontal area. The introduction of curved underbody features also helped to improve aerodynamics significantly over the 2003/2004 body.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chassis was redesigned to fit the new underbody fairing as well as improve durability and increase stiffness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reduced displacement engine posed many challenges both in development and integration into the vehicle.

The vehicle had an actual underbody versus previous year&#8217;s sheet metal body pan.
  </p>

  <p>
    2004 was the first time the team implemented a fuel injection system on the engine. There was much experience gained during its development.

It was the first step towards advancing the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Windtunnel testing proved useful in showing separation behind the front wheel areas on earlier prototypes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chassis was constructed using honeycomb sandwich panels donated by Avcorp.

It featured an open-wheeled design with kevlar chassis and fibreglass fairing.
