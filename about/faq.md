#### What is Supermileage or the Shell Eco-Marathon?

Both are competitions to build the most energy-efficient vehicle possible.

#### Where is UBC located?

We are located in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We are situated on the west coast of Canada, just north of Washington state. Click [here][2] for a mailing address.

#### Do you have a competition press release? Where can I get more information?

Yes, a press release or more info may be obtained by [emailing][2] the team.

#### What did you do to the prototype vehicle to yield such large increases to your mileage?

We keep our vehicle as spartan as possible, with only the bare essentials to keep the vehicle lightweight. Aerodynamics, rolling resistance, driving technique and engine performance are always being revisited and continuously improved.

Contact us for a press release or just to ask a few questions. We will be happy to answer your questions.

#### Why did you move onto the Urban Concept vehicle instead of continue with the Prototype?

We are very excited about the Urban Concept class; it more closely resembles an &#8220;everyday&#8221; vehicle. We feel as though this is an excellent opportunity to continue with our goals, and apply what we have learned in the prototype class to a more practical vehicle. As a small team in 2009/2010, we did not have the bandwidth to attempt both projects, and the Urban Concept Car was an exciting, relevant opportunity for us to evolve the team. Since our decision to move to the Urban Concept Class, the team has grown significantly, showing that we weren&#8217;t the only ones excited about the project!

In the past year, we&#8217;ve had a lot of interest from new members , and we&#8217;re proud to announce that we now have the personal to enter both the Prototype and Urban Concept categories!

#### You don&#8217;t have the highest mileage in the world. That&#8217;s held by the Shell Eco-Marathon teams!

Every competition is governed by different rules and run on a different type of track. Since the Shell Eco-Marathon is a fairly newly revived competition in North America, our prototype had been designed for and entered primarily in the SAE Supermileage competition. The urban concept vehicle has been designed specifically for the Shell Eco-Marathon.

Teams in the Eco-Marathon have carte-blanc on engine design where the SAE Supermileage competition is much more heavily regulated with the use of a pre-determined Briggs and Stratton engine that you have to design from.

#### What&#8217;s the point of a gas fuel-efficiency competition, shouldn&#8217;t you be working on solar car or fuel cell vehicle?

Supermileage is mostly dedicated to creating energy efficient vehicles, regardless of the energy source. In the long run, UBCST aims to work on implementing an alternate energy source on our urban concept vehicle. Until this transition, we will continue to work with the most commonly used fuel source: gasoline. While we are still using gas, it&#8217;s important for us to reduce it&#8217;s impact.
